My name is Ted. I'm a CTO, electronic and signal processing engineer and programs & project manager. 
I'm originally from telAviv, Israel, but I moved up norht 2014.
I love all foods, particularly Israeli midetriaan food, but strangely 
I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese and egs. I'm not allergic, 
I just hate it! I make an exception for cream cheese and 
mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
