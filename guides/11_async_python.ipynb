    "- They all start running at t=0ms\n",
    "- They all need to run for exactly 1 second\n",
    "- But tiny differences in when they actually cross the finish line create the order\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening under the hood:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "All 9 tasks call asyncio.sleep(1) at nearly the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 10: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0001ms\n",
    "Task 11: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0003ms  (slightly later!)\n",
    "Task 12: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0002ms\n",
    "Task 20: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0005ms  (even later!)\n",
    "Task 21: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0004ms\n",
    "Task 22: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0006ms\n",
    "Task 30: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0000ms  (earliest!)\n",
    "Task 31: sleep(1) → timer set for 1000.0007ms\n",

    "- Task 30 wakes first (1000.0000ms) → prints \"Complete 30\"\n",
    "- Task 10 wakes next (1000.0001ms) → prints \"Complete 10\"  \n",

    "- ... and so on\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Why these tiny differences exist:**\n",
    "1. **Event loop scheduling** - Tasks are scheduled in the order they're created, but there's a tiny delay between each\n",
    "2. **System timer precision** - Your OS's timer might have microsecond-level variations\n",
    "3. **Event loop overhead** - The loop itself takes tiny amounts of time to process each task\n",
    "4. **Python interpreter** - Small variations in how Python schedules coroutines\n",
